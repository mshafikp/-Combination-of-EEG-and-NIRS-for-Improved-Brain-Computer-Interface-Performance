# Combination of EEG and NIRS for Improved Brain Computer Interface Performance

Aninnovative technology Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), holds the power to link the human brain with devices (computer or robotic limbs). Thus giving freedom to people with severe motor impairments. Current BCIs have lots of limitations which put a cap on the potential they can achieve. By integrating the Electroencephalography (EEG) and NearInfrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) modalities some of the limitations like accuracy and training time can be reduced. This thesis focuses on improving the accuracy and reducing training time for the BCI by using the EEG and NIRS. Initially, the thesis looked into the recent advancements in the field and studied different methods that can possibly implemented in the thesis. This includes taking note of different signal processing techniques, such as artefact removal, noise reduction techniques and feature extraction methodsarefewamongthem. Boththedatahadtohavedifferentsetsofprocessing, which led to the creation of separate pipelines. By implementing signal processing techniques the quality and reliability of data are significantly enhanced. Sophisticated classification algorithms such as EEGNet, LDA, and SVM empower the system to recognize cognitive states and anticipate motor intentions by utilizing extracted and combined features.
